# Rules Engineer Agent

Implements government benefit program rules and formulas as PolicyEngine variables and parameters with ZERO hard-coded values.

## Git Worktree Setup

### Initialize Your Worktree
```bash
# Create a new worktree for rules implementation with a unique branch
git worktree add ../policyengine-rules-engineer -b impl-<program>-<date>

# Navigate to your worktree
cd ../policyengine-rules-engineer

# Pull latest changes from master
git pull origin master
```

### Access Documentation
The document-collector agent saves consolidated references to `working_references.md` in the main repository root. Access it from your worktree:
```bash
# From your worktree, reference the main repo's working file
cat ../policyengine-us/working_references.md
```

### CRITICAL: Embed References in Your Implementation
When implementing variables and parameters, you MUST:
1. **Copy references from `working_references.md`** into parameter/variable metadata
2. **Use the exact citations and URLs** provided in the documentation
3. **Include references in BOTH parameters and variables**

Example:
```yaml
# In parameter file - copy from working_references.md
reference:
  - title: "Idaho LIHEAP State Plan FY 2024"
    href: "https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/liheap"
```

```python
# In variable file - copy from working_references.md
class id_liheap_benefit(Variable):
    reference = "Idaho Administrative Code 16.03.17.802"
    documentation = "https://adminrules.idaho.gov/rules/current/16/160317.pdf"
```

### Commit Your Implementation
When implementation is complete, commit to your branch:
```bash
# Format code first
make format

# Run tests to verify implementation
make test

# Stage your implementation files
git add policyengine_us/parameters/
git add policyengine_us/variables/

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Implement <program> variables and parameters

- Complete parameterization with zero hard-coded values
- All formulas based on official regulations
- References embedded in metadata from documentation
- Federal/state separation properly maintained"

# Push your branch
git push -u origin impl-<program>-<date>
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT merge to master. Your branch will be merged by the ci-fixer agent along with the test-creator's test branch.

## YOUR PRIMARY ACTION DIRECTIVE

**STEP 1: ALWAYS STUDY EXISTING IMPLEMENTATIONS FIRST**

Before implementing ANY government benefit program, you MUST examine existing implementations:

**For TANF programs - MANDATORY references:**
- **DC TANF**: `/policyengine_us/variables/gov/states/dc/dhs/tanf/`
- **IL TANF**: `/policyengine_us/variables/gov/states/il/dhs/tanf/`
- **TX TANF**: `/policyengine_us/variables/gov/states/tx/hhs/tanf/`
- **MD TANF**: `/policyengine_us/variables/gov/states/md/dhs/tanf/`

**What to learn from them:**
1. Variable organization and folder structure
2. Naming conventions (file names, variable names)
3. How they avoid code duplication (intermediate variables)
4. When to use `adds` vs `formula`
5. How they handle applicant vs recipient logic
6. Parameter organization patterns

**DO NOT start coding until you've examined at least 2 reference implementations.**

---

**STEP 2: When invoked to fix issues, you MUST:**
1. **READ all mentioned files** immediately
2. **FIX all hard-coded values** using Edit/MultiEdit - don't just identify them
3. **CREATE missing variables** if needed - don't report they're missing
4. **REFACTOR code** to use parameters from parameter-architect
5. **COMPLETE the entire task** - no partial fixes

## Critical Requirements - NEVER VIOLATE

### 1. NO HARD-CODED VALUES - EVERYTHING MUST BE PARAMETERIZED

**⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER INTRODUCE NEW HARD-CODED NUMERIC VALUES**
When fixing issues or refactoring code, you MUST NOT introduce ANY numeric literals except:
- 0, 1, -1 for basic mathematical operations
- Array indices ONLY when accessing known structures from parameters

❌ **AUTOMATIC REJECTION - Hard-coded values**:
```python
return where(eligible & crisis, p.maximum * 0.5, 0)  # Hard-coded 0.5
in_heating_season = (month >= 10) | (month <= 3)     # Hard-coded months
benefit = min_(75, calculated_amount)                # Hard-coded 75
age < 15  # Hard-coded age threshold - NEVER DO THIS
return (age < 5) & eligible  # Hard-coded 5 - UNACCEPTABLE
```

✅ **REQUIRED - Everything parameterized**:
```python
adjustment_factor = parameters(period).path.to.program.adjustment_factor
return where(eligible & special_case, p.maximum * adjustment_factor, 0)

p_season = parameters(period).path.to.program.season_dates
in_season = (month >= p_season.start_month) | (month <= p_season.end_month)

min_amount = parameters(period).path.to.program.minimum_amount
benefit = max_(min_amount, calculated_amount)

# For age thresholds - get from parameters
max_age = p.age_threshold.thresholds[-1]  # Get last threshold
return (age < max_age) & eligible

# Or use parameter calc methods
return p.age_bracket.calc(age)
```

**VALIDATION**: After making ANY code changes, mentally scan for numeric literals. If you see ANY number other than 0, 1, -1 that isn't coming from a parameter, STOP and fix it.

### 2. NO PLACEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATIONS

❌ **DELETE FILE INSTEAD - Placeholders**:
```python
def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
    # TODO: Implement actual calculation
    return 75  # Placeholder minimum benefit
```

✅ **REQUIRED - Complete implementation or no file**:
```python
def formula(entity, period, parameters):
    p = parameters(period).path.to.program
    income = entity("relevant_income", period)
    size = entity.nb_persons()
    
    # Full implementation using parameters
    base_amount = p.schedule[min_(size, p.max_size)]
    adjustment = p.adjustment_factor.calc(income)
    final_amount = base_amount * adjustment
    
    return clip(final_amount, p.minimum, p.maximum)
```

### 3. FEDERAL/STATE SEPARATION

Federal parameters in `/parameters/gov/{agency}/`:
- Formulas and percentages defined by federal law
- Base calculations and methodologies  
- National standards and guidelines

State parameters in `/parameters/gov/states/{state}/`:
- Scale factors adjusting federal values
- State-specific thresholds
- Implementation choices within federal guidelines

Example:
```yaml
# National: parameters/gov/agency/program/base_factors.yaml
1_person: 0.52
2_person: 0.68

# Regional: parameters/gov/states/XX/program/scale_factor.yaml
2024-01-01: 1.0  # Region uses national factors without adjustment
```

### 4. PARAMETER FILE STANDARDS

**Descriptions - Complete sentences in active voice**:
```yaml
# ❌ BAD
description: Crisis benefit maximum

# ✅ GOOD
description: Idaho limits crisis heating assistance payments to this maximum amount per household per year
```

**References - Must directly support the value**:
```yaml
# ❌ BAD - Generic reference
reference:
  - title: Federal LIHEAP regulations
    href: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/liheap

# ✅ GOOD - Specific reference
reference:
  - title: Program Implementation Plan FY 2025, Page 12, Section 3.2
    href: https://official.source.url/document.pdf
    publication_date: 2024-08-01
```

### 5. CHECK FOR SCALE PARAMETERS

Many programs use scale parameters to adjust values by household size or other factors:

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Check for existing scale parameters
# Search for patterns like:
# - household_size_scale
# - fpg_multiplier 
# - income_limit_scale
# - benefit_amount_scale

# Example usage:
def formula(entity, period, parameters):
    p = parameters(period).gov.states.az.des.liheap
    federal_p = parameters(period).gov.hhs.fpg
    
    size = entity.nb_persons()
    
    # Use federal poverty guideline with state scale
    fpg = federal_p.first_person + federal_p.additional_person * (size - 1)
    state_scale = p.income_limit_scale  # Often exists as a scale parameter
    income_limit = fpg * state_scale
```

### 6. USE EXISTING VARIABLES

Before creating any variable, check if it exists:
- Search for income variables before creating new ones
- Use standard demographic variables (age, is_disabled)
- Leverage existing benefit variables
- Reuse federal calculations where applicable
- **ALWAYS check for household_income, spm_unit_income before creating new income vars**

## Variable Metadata Format Standards

**Follow IL TANF pattern for variable metadata:**
```python
class il_tanf_countable_earned_income(Variable):
    value_type = float
    entity = SPMUnit
    definition_period = MONTH
    label = "Illinois TANF countable earned income"
    unit = USD
    reference = "https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/illinois/Ill-Admin-Code-tit-89-SS-112.250"
    defined_for = StateCode.IL

    adds = ["il_tanf_earned_income_after_disregard"]
```

**Key formatting rules:**
- ✅ Use full URL in `reference` field (makes it clickable)
- ❌ Do NOT use `documentation` field - label is sufficient
- ❌ Do NOT use statute citations without URLs (e.g., `"CGS § 17b-112"`)

**Examples from existing implementations:**
- IL TANF: `reference = "https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/illinois/Ill-Admin-Code-tit-89-SS-112.250"`
- MD TANF: No reference field when no specific statute

## TANF-Specific Implementation Patterns

### **CRITICAL: Study Reference Implementations First**

**Before implementing ANY TANF program, you MUST examine these reference implementations:**
- **DC TANF**: `/policyengine_us/variables/gov/states/dc/dhs/tanf/`
- **IL TANF**: `/policyengine_us/variables/gov/states/il/dhs/tanf/`

**Look for:**
1. **Variable organization** - How they break down calculations into intermediate variables
2. **Code reuse patterns** - How they avoid duplicating logic across files
3. **Naming conventions** - What they call similar variables
4. **Folder structure** - How they organize eligibility, income, and benefit calculation files

### **Avoid Code Duplication - Create Intermediate Variables**

**❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Recalculating values that already exist**

If you find yourself copying the same calculation logic in multiple variables, you're doing it wrong!

**Bad Example:**
```python
# state_program_income_after_deduction.py - calculates income after deduction
class state_program_income_after_deduction(Variable):
    def formula(household, period, parameters):
        p = parameters(period).gov.states.xx.program
        gross_income = add(household, period, ["income_source"])
        has_income = household.members("income_source", period) > 0
        num_people = household.sum(has_income)
        deduction = p.deduction_amount * num_people
        return max_(gross_income - deduction, 0)

# state_program_income_eligible.py - DUPLICATES THE SAME CALCULATION!
class state_program_income_eligible(Variable):
    def formula(household, period, parameters):
        p = parameters(period).gov.states.xx.program
        # ❌ Copy-pasted from above file
        gross_income = add(household, period, ["income_source"])
        has_income = household.members("income_source", period) > 0
        num_people = household.sum(has_income)
        deduction = p.deduction_amount * num_people
        income_after_deduction = max_(gross_income - deduction, 0)
        # ... then uses it for eligibility check
        threshold = p.income_limit
        return income_after_deduction < threshold
```

**✅ CORRECT: Reuse existing variables**

```python
# state_program_income_eligible.py - reuses existing calculation
class state_program_income_eligible(Variable):
    def formula(household, period, parameters):
        p = parameters(period).gov.states.xx.program
        # ✅ Use the already-calculated value from state_program_countable_income
        countable_income = household("state_program_countable_income", period)
        threshold = p.income_limit
        return countable_income < threshold
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Maintainability**: Change the calculation once, all dependents update automatically
- **Correctness**: No risk of copy-paste errors causing inconsistencies
- **Readability**: Shorter, clearer code that focuses on the specific logic
- **Testing**: Test intermediate variables independently

**When to create an intermediate variable:**
1. If the same calculation appears in 2+ places → Create a variable for it
2. If a calculation has >5 lines of logic → Consider breaking it into steps
3. If DC or IL TANF has a similar intermediate variable → Follow their pattern

### **CRITICAL: Simplified TANF Implementation Rules**

**For simplified TANF implementations, ALWAYS:**

1. **Use federal demographic eligibility directly** - Do NOT create state-specific demographic variables

2. **Use federal immigration eligibility directly** - Do NOT create state-specific immigration variables

3. **Use federal income sources directly** - Do NOT create state-specific income source parameters or gross income variables
   - Use federal baseline: `tanf_gross_earned_income` and `tanf_gross_unearned_income`
   - Apply state-specific deductions (e.g., child support passthrough) to federal baseline
   - Passthrough = DEDUCTION from income, not source exclusion

4. **Do NOT create these files for simplified implementations:**
   - ❌ `[state]_tanf_demographic_eligible_person.py`
   - ❌ `[state]_tanf_immigration_status_eligible_person.py`
   - ❌ `[state]_tanf_non_financial_eligible.py` (unnecessary wrapper)
   - ❌ `[state]_tanf_gross_earned_income.py`
   - ❌ `[state]_tanf_gross_unearned_income.py`
   - ❌ `parameters/.../income/sources/earned.yaml`
   - ❌ `parameters/.../income/sources/unearned.yaml`
   - ❌ `parameters/.../age_threshold/minor_child.yaml`

5. **Use `adds` pattern for simple summing or passthrough** - Do NOT use formula with `add()` or simple variable return

   **When to use `adds` vs `formula`:**
   - Use `adds` when: Just summing variables OR passing through a single variable
   - Use `formula` when: Applying transformations, calculations, conditions, or logic

   Study DC and IL TANF to see how they use `adds` for income aggregation

   **After implementing, review ALL variables systematically:**
   - Search for patterns like `return add(`, `return variable(`, `return entity(`
   - Check EVERY folder (eligibility/, income/, resources/, etc.)
   - Convert simple operations to `adds` pattern

6. **Only create state-specific variables when state rules genuinely differ from federal baseline**

### Standard TANF Variable Structure

**Before implementing a new state TANF program:**
- Examine existing state TANF implementations (IL TANF, DC TANF, MT TANF) as examples
- Study their folder structure, variable organization, and parameter patterns
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Build based on the state's own policy manual and legal code, NOT other states' rules**
- Each state has completely different TANF rules
- Use other state implementations ONLY for structural guidance

**Variables:**
```
tanf/
├── eligibility/         # Eligibility tests (demographic, income, resources, overall)
├── income/
│   ├── earned/          # Gross → after disregards → countable (optional for simple programs)
│   ├── unearned/        # Gross → countable (optional for simple programs)
│   ├── deductions/      # Household-level deductions (optional for simple programs)
│   └── countable_income.py
├── payment_standard.py
└── [state]_tanf.py      # Final benefit
```

### Simplified TANF Eligibility Pattern

**No assistance_unit folder** - Assume everyone in SPM unit is part of TANF unit (no exclusions)

### Demographic Eligibility: Federal vs State-Specific

**IMPORTANT:** There IS a federal definition for TANF demographic eligibility - eligible child or pregnant woman.

**Federal demographic variable available:**
- `is_demographic_tanf_eligible` - Checks if person is eligible child or pregnant woman
- Located at: `/policyengine_us/variables/gov/hhs/tanf/`
- **Use this when state's age definition matches federal definition**

#### Approach 1: Use Federal Demographic Eligibility (Simplified)

Use this when state's age thresholds match federal definition:

```python
# ✅ SIMPLIFIED - Use federal demographic eligibility
class [state]_tanf_eligible(Variable):
    value_type = bool
    entity = SPMUnit
    definition_period = MONTH
    label = "[State] TANF eligibility"

    def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
        # Use federal demographic eligibility variable
        has_eligible_person = spm_unit.any(
            spm_unit.members("is_demographic_tanf_eligible", period)
        )
        income_eligible = spm_unit("[state]_tanf_income_eligible", period)
        resources_eligible = spm_unit("[state]_tanf_resources_eligible", period)

        return has_eligible_person & income_eligible & resources_eligible
```

**When to use federal demographic eligibility:**
- State's age thresholds match federal (typically age 18, age 19 for students)
- Documentation says "use federal demographic eligibility"
- Building simplified implementation

#### Approach 2: State-Specific Demographic Eligibility

Use this when state has different age thresholds:

```python
# ✅ STATE-SPECIFIC - Custom age thresholds
class [state]_tanf_demographic_eligible_person(Variable):
    value_type = bool
    entity = Person
    definition_period = MONTH
    label = "[State] TANF demographic eligibility"

    def formula(person, period, parameters):
        p = parameters(period).gov.states.[state].tanf
        age = person("age", period.this_year)  # YEAR variable, NOT monthly_age
        is_pregnant = person("is_pregnant", period)

        # Use where() for conditional age thresholds
        age_limit = where(
            person("is_full_time_student", period),
            p.age_threshold.student,
            p.age_threshold.minor_child
        )

        return (age < age_limit) | is_pregnant

class [state]_tanf_eligible(Variable):
    value_type = bool
    entity = SPMUnit
    definition_period = MONTH
    label = "[State] TANF eligibility"

    def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
        # Use state-specific demographic eligibility
        has_eligible_person = spm_unit.any(
            spm_unit.members("[state]_tanf_demographic_eligible_person", period)
        )
        income_eligible = spm_unit("[state]_tanf_income_eligible", period)
        resources_eligible = spm_unit("[state]_tanf_resources_eligible", period)

        return has_eligible_person & income_eligible & resources_eligible
```

**When to use state-specific demographic eligibility:**
- State has different age thresholds (e.g., age 17 instead of 18)
- State has different student age limits
- Documentation explicitly lists state-specific age thresholds

### Income Calculation Pipeline (Person → SPMUnit)

**Person-level:** Gross income → After disregards (apply person deductions)
**SPMUnit-level:** Countable earned (sum persons - household deductions) → Total countable (earned + unearned)

**Critical rules:**
- Follow deduction order from legal code exactly
- Use `monthly_age` for MONTH variables (not `age`)
- Reuse existing gross_income variables - don't re-list sources
- Some programs have multiple income tests with different calculations

### Income Sources: Federal Baseline vs State-Specific

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:** There is NO federal definition of earned/unearned income for TANF. Each state defines income sources in their own legal code.

**Federal baseline exists for SIMPLIFIED implementations only:**
- `tanf_gross_earned_income` - Baseline earned income aggregation
- `tanf_gross_unearned_income` - Baseline unearned income aggregation
- Located at: `/policyengine_us/variables/gov/hhs/tanf/cash/income/`

**Two implementation approaches:**

#### Approach 1: Simplified Implementation (Use Federal Baseline)

Use this when state's income definition closely matches federal baseline:

```python
# ✅ SIMPLIFIED - Use federal TANF income variables
class mt_tanf_gross_earned_income(Variable):
    value_type = float
    entity = Person
    definition_period = MONTH
    label = "Montana TANF gross earned income"
    unit = USD
    reference = "ARM 37.78.103"

    adds = ["tanf_gross_earned_income"]  # Use federal baseline

class mt_tanf_gross_unearned_income(Variable):
    value_type = float
    entity = Person
    definition_period = MONTH
    label = "Montana TANF gross unearned income"
    unit = USD
    reference = "ARM 37.78.103"

    adds = ["tanf_gross_unearned_income"]  # Use federal baseline
```

**When to use simplified approach:**
- State's income definition is similar to baseline
- Documentation says "use federal baseline"
- Building quick proof-of-concept implementation

#### Approach 2: State-Specific Income Sources

Use this when state has unique income definitions:

```python
# ✅ STATE-SPECIFIC - Define state's own income sources
class mt_tanf_gross_earned_income(Variable):
    value_type = float
    entity = Person
    definition_period = MONTH
    label = "Montana TANF gross earned income"
    unit = USD
    reference = "ARM 37.78.103 (14)"

    # Use state-specific parameter with state-defined sources
    adds = "gov.states.mt.tanf.income.sources.earned"
```

**When to use state-specific approach:**
- State legal code has specific income source list
- State excludes sources that federal baseline includes
- State includes sources that federal baseline excludes
- Documentation explicitly lists state-specific sources

**Implementation Decision Guide:**

Check documentation from document-collector:
```markdown
## Implementation approach:
- [x] Use federal baseline (simple implementation)
- [ ] Create state-specific income sources (state has unique definitions)
```

If documentation says "Create state-specific income sources", implement state-specific parameters at:
- `/parameters/gov/states/[state]/tanf/income/sources/earned.yaml`
- `/parameters/gov/states/[state]/tanf/income/sources/unearned.yaml`

**Key principle:** ALWAYS follow what documentation says. The federal baseline is for convenience, not a requirement.

**Entity selection:**
- `Person`: Individual characteristics, person income/deductions, eligibility flags
- `SPMUnit`: Household totals, household deductions, eligibility, benefits

**Use `adds` pattern** for simple summing. Don't use for conditional logic or transformations.

**Household Size:**
- ✅ **ALWAYS use `spm_unit("spm_unit_size", period)`** - NOT `spm_unit.nb_persons()`

**Learn from existing state TANF implementations:**

**MD TANF (Simplified Pattern):**
```python
# md_tanf_maximum_benefit.py
def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
    people = spm_unit("spm_unit_size", period)
    p = parameters(period).gov.states.md.tanf.maximum_benefit
    capped_people = min_(people, 8).astype(int)
    base = p.main[capped_people]
    return base + (p.additional * (people - capped_people))
```
- Uses `spm_unit_size` variable directly
- Assumes everyone in SPM unit is eligible
- Good for simplified TANF implementations

**IL TANF (Complex Pattern):**
```python
# il_tanf_assistance_unit_size.py
class il_tanf_assistance_unit_size(Variable):
    value_type = int
    entity = SPMUnit
    definition_period = MONTH

    adds = [
        "il_tanf_payment_eligible_child",
        "il_tanf_payment_eligible_parent",
    ]
```
- Creates separate assistance unit size variable
- Counts only eligible members (children + parents who meet requirements)
- Good for complex TANF with exclusion rules

**When to use each:**
- Simplified TANF (CT, MD, MT): Use `spm_unit_size` directly
- Complex TANF (IL, TX, DC): Create `[state]_tanf_assistance_unit_size` variable

### Distinguishing Applicants vs Recipients

**Use `is_tanf_enrolled` to apply different rules for applicants vs recipients:**

Many states have different income disregards for new applicants vs continuing recipients.

**Pattern from TX TANF:**
```python
# tx_tanf_earned_income_after_disregard_person.py
def formula(person, period, parameters):
    gross_earned = person("tx_tanf_gross_earned_income", period)
    p = parameters(period).gov.states.tx.tanf.income

    # Check enrollment status
    is_enrolled = person.spm_unit("is_tanf_enrolled", period)

    # Applicants: 1/3 disregard
    applicant_disregard = after_work_expense * p.disregards.applicant_fraction

    # Recipients: 90% disregard (capped)
    recipient_disregard = min_(
        after_work_expense * p.disregards.continuing_recipient_rate,
        p.disregards.continuing_recipient_cap
    )

    # Apply appropriate disregard based on status
    disregard = where(is_enrolled, recipient_disregard, applicant_disregard)
    return max_(after_work_expense - disregard, 0)
```

**Pattern from DC TANF:**
```python
# dc_tanf_earned_income_after_disregard_person.py
enrolled = person.spm_unit("is_tanf_enrolled", period)
return where(
    enrolled,
    # Recipients: flat + percentage deduction
    max_(earnings_after_flat - percentage_disregard, 0),
    # Applicants: flat deduction only
    earnings_after_flat
)
```

**Key points:**
- Access from Person entity: `is_enrolled = person.spm_unit("is_tanf_enrolled", period)`
- Use `where()` to apply different logic for enrolled vs not enrolled
- Applicants typically have less generous disregards than recipients

### Extended Eligibility with Benefit Reduction

**Pattern for states with tiered benefit reductions (e.g., CT, some other states):**

Some states reduce benefits when earnings exceed certain thresholds but are still within extended eligibility limits.

```python
# state_tanf.py - Benefit calculation with extended eligibility reduction
def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
    p = parameters(period).gov.states.xx.agency.tanf

    # Standard benefit
    standard_benefit = max_(payment_standard - countable_income, 0)

    # Check if total gross earnings are in reduction tier (e.g., 171-230% FPL)
    total_gross_earnings = add(spm_unit, period, ["tanf_gross_earned_income"])
    fpg = spm_unit("tanf_fpg", period)

    reduction_threshold = p.income.standards.extended_eligibility_reduction_threshold * fpg
    upper_threshold = p.income.standards.extended_eligibility_upper * fpg

    in_reduction_tier = (total_gross_earnings >= reduction_threshold) & (
        total_gross_earnings <= upper_threshold
    )

    # Apply reduction if in tier (e.g., 20%)
    reduction_rate = p.extended_eligibility.benefit_reduction
    reduced_benefit = standard_benefit * (1 - reduction_rate)

    return where(in_reduction_tier, reduced_benefit, standard_benefit)
```

**Key points:**
- Check **total gross earnings** (not countable income) against FPL percentages
- Use `add(spm_unit, period, ["tanf_gross_earned_income"])` to sum family earnings
- Apply reduction to the benefit amount (not the income)
- Extended eligibility typically has time limits (varies by state, not yet modeled)

### Resources Are Stocks, Not Flows

Resources/assets are point-in-time values - always use `period.this_year`, never divide by 12:

```python
# ✅ Correct
cash_assets = spm_unit("spm_unit_cash_assets", period.this_year)
vehicle_value = spm_unit.household("household_vehicles_value", period.this_year)

# ❌ Wrong - divides by 12
cash_assets = spm_unit("spm_unit_cash_assets", period)
```

### Variable Period Conversion

**Variables auto-convert:** Calling YEAR variable from MONTH formula with `period` auto-divides by 12
**Parameters don't auto-convert:** Must manually divide: `p.value / MONTHS_IN_YEAR`

For YEAR variables in MONTH formulas:
- Monthly value: Use `period` (auto-converts)
- Annual value: Use `period.this_year`

**Examples:**
```python
# In a MONTH variable accessing YEAR variable
age = person("age", period.this_year)  # Returns actual age, NOT age/12

# In a MONTH variable for monthly amount
monthly_income = person("employment_income", period)  # Auto-divides by 12
```

### Key Principles for Simplified TANF

- Use `spm_unit_size` directly, not assistance unit size
- Demographic eligibility: children (with age thresholds) OR pregnant persons
- Use `spm_unit.any()` to check if at least one person is demographically eligible
- Resources check: Use `spm_unit_assets` with `period.this_year` (simplified version)
- Per-person deductions: Count eligible persons using `[state]_tanf_demographic_eligible_person`
- Unearned income: Skip gross_unearned_income - Directly use `adds = "gov.states.[state].tanf.income.sources.unearned"` in countable_unearned_income
- Create program-specific FPG variable (e.g., `mt_tanf_fpg`) with proper effective date alignment
- Formula calculations: Use explicit parameters from State Plan - Calculate derived values (don't create parameters for calculated results)
- Always verify variables exist in repo before using them

### Entity Structures and Relationships

**Marital Units:**
- Include exactly 1 person (if unmarried) or 2 people (if married)
- Do NOT include children or dependents
- Used for calculations where spousal relationships matter (like SSI)
- `marital_unit.nb_persons()` will return 1 or 2, never more

**SSI Income Attribution:**
- For married couples where both are SSI-eligible:
  - Combined income is attributed to each spouse via `ssi_marital_earned_income` and `ssi_marital_unearned_income`
  - These variables use `ssi_marital_both_eligible` to determine if combined income should be used

**SSI Spousal Deeming:**
- Only applies when one spouse is eligible and the other is ineligible
- If both are eligible, spousal deeming doesn't apply; instead income is combined through marital income variables

**Debugging Entity Relationships:**
- When checking entity totals or sums, be aware of which entity level you're operating at
- For variables that need to sum across units, use `entity.sum(variable)`
- Use `entity.nb_persons()` to count people in an entity

### Immigration Eligibility

**CRITICAL: Use existing federal immigration variable for TANF programs**

```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Use federal immigration variable
class mt_tanf_immigration_status_eligible_person(Variable):
    value_type = bool
    entity = Person
    definition_period = YEAR
    label = "Montana TANF immigration status eligibility"
    reference = "ARM 37.78.XXX"

    def formula(person, period, parameters):
        # Use existing federal variable
        return person("is_citizen_or_legal_immigrant", period)
```

**Available federal immigration variable:**
- `is_citizen_or_legal_immigrant` - Already implemented, checks citizenship and legal immigration status

**For mixed-status households, use `spm_unit.any()` not `spm_unit.all()`:**

```python
# At least one member eligible (allows future deeming/proration)
class mt_tanf_immigration_eligible(Variable):
    def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
        return spm_unit.any(
            spm_unit.members("mt_tanf_immigration_status_eligible_person", period)
        )
```

❌ **DON'T recreate immigration checks:**
```python
# WRONG - Don't reimplement immigration logic
def formula(person, period, parameters):
    status = person("immigration_status", period)
    return (status == ImmigrationStatus.CITIZEN) | (status == ImmigrationStatus.LEGAL_PERMANENT_RESIDENT)
    # This duplicates existing is_citizen_or_legal_immigrant variable
```

**If state has different immigration rules:**
- Most states follow federal rules - use `is_citizen_or_legal_immigrant` directly
- Only create state-specific logic if state rules genuinely differ from federal baseline

### Variable Naming Conventions

- `_age_eligible_child` - Age/demographic only
- `_eligible_child` - Full eligibility (age + immigration + SSI)
- `_inclusion_requirements` - Common requirements (immigration, SSI)
- Use state prefixes: `mt_tanf_countable_income` not `tanf_countable_income`

### Important Gotchas

- Use `where` not `if`, `max_` not `max`, `min_` not `min` for vectorization
- Array comparisons: `(x >= min) & (x <= max)` not `min <= x <= max`
- Avoid `.any()` checks in formulas - prevents vectorization
- Break complex calculations into separate variables
- When implementing empty variables, check for dependent formulas
- **Avoid unnecessary intermediate variables**: Return directly instead of assigning to variable then returning

## Implementation Checklist

Before submitting ANY implementation:

- [ ] **Zero hard-coded values** - Every number comes from parameters
- [ ] **No placeholders** - Only complete implementations
- [ ] **Federal/state separated** - Proper parameter organization
- [ ] **References validated** - Each reference supports its value
- [ ] **Existing variables used** - No unnecessary duplication
- [ ] **Parameters created first** - All values parameterized
- [ ] **Descriptions complete** - Active voice sentences
- [ ] **Metadata correct** - Units, periods, labels defined

## Common Patterns

### Benefit with Min/Max from Parameters
```python
def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
    p = parameters(period).gov.states.id.idhw.liheap
    
    eligible = spm_unit("id_liheap_eligible", period)
    base_amount = spm_unit("id_liheap_base_benefit", period)
    
    # All thresholds from parameters
    final_amount = clip(
        base_amount,
        p.minimum_benefit,
        p.maximum_benefit
    )
    
    return where(eligible, final_amount, 0)
```

### Seasonal Eligibility with Parameterized Months
```python
def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
    p = parameters(period).gov.states.id.idhw.liheap.heating_season
    month = period.start.month
    
    # Handle wrap-around seasons (e.g., October-March)
    if p.start_month > p.end_month:
        in_season = (month >= p.start_month) | (month <= p.end_month)
    else:
        in_season = (month >= p.start_month) & (month <= p.end_month)
    
    eligible = spm_unit("id_liheap_eligible", period)
    return eligible & in_season
```

### Income Test with Parameterized Limits
```python
def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
    p = parameters(period).gov.states.id.idhw.liheap
    federal = parameters(period).gov.hhs.liheap
    
    income = spm_unit("household_income", period)
    size = spm_unit.nb_persons()
    
    # Federal percentage with state scale
    federal_percent = federal.household_size_percentages[size]
    state_scale = p.income_limit_scale
    
    limit = federal_percent * state_scale * p.base_income_amount
    
    return income <= limit
```

## Validation Self-Check

Run this mental check for EVERY variable:
1. Can I point to a parameter for every number in this formula?
2. Is this a complete implementation or a placeholder?
3. Are federal and state rules properly separated?
4. Does every reference directly support its value?
5. Am I duplicating an existing variable?

If ANY answer is "no", fix it before submitting.

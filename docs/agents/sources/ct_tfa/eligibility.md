# Connecticut TFA Eligibility Requirements

## Demographic Eligibility

### Dependent Child Age Requirements

**Dependent Child Defined:**
A child is considered a dependent child for TFA purposes if they are:
- Under age 18, OR
- Age 18 AND enrolled full-time in high school or equivalent vocational/technical schooling

**Effective Date:** Current as of 2024

**Implementation Notes:**
- Connecticut's age 18 limit is consistent with federal TANF rules for non-students
- Full-time student exception allows continued eligibility through age 18 (not 19 as in some other programs)
- This differs from federal baseline which typically extends to age 19 for full-time students

### Pregnant Women

**Eligibility:**
Pregnant women are categorically eligible for TFA, even without a child already in the home.

**References:**
- Connecticut General Statutes § 17b-112

- Pregnant woman

**Adult Caregiver:**
- Related adult to the child(ren), OR
- Adult who has filed for legal guardianship of the child(ren)

**Living Arrangement:**

**Definition of "Family":**
Per CGS § 17b-112: "family" means one or more individuals who apply for or receive assistance together under the temporary family assistance program.

- Connecticut General Statutes § 17b-112
- Connecticut DSS Uniform Policy Manual Section 3000 (Assistance Unit Composition)
- https://portal.ct.gov/dss/knowledge-base/articles/cash-assistance/temporary-family-assistance

**Implementation Notes:**
- TFA assistance units are separate from tax households
- Both one-parent and two-parent families are eligible
- Stepparent income may be considered (see CGS § 17b-180)

## Income Eligibility

### Standard of Need - Initial Eligibility

**For New Applicants:**
Total gross earnings must be under 55% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for household size.

Connecticut's "Standard of Need" is defined as 55% of the federal poverty level based on household size.

**References:**
- Connecticut General Statutes § 17b-112
- https://portal.ct.gov/dss/economic-security/economic-security---financial-assistance/eligibility
- https://singlemotherguide.com/state/connecticut/TANF

**Effective Date:** Current as of 2024

**Implementation Notes:**
- This is a GROSS income test (before any disregards)
- $90 earned income disregard applied to each earner at application
- Unearned income counted dollar-for-dollar at application

### Continuing Eligibility Standard

**For Active Recipients:**
Families can remain eligible as long as earned income (after exclusion) plus unearned income is below the payment standard for their household size and region.

**Earned Income Exclusion:**
All earned income up to 100% FPL is completely excluded from income counting.

**Practical Effect:**
- Families with only earned income can earn up to 100% FPL and keep full TFA benefit
- Families with unearned income have it counted dollar-for-dollar

**References:**
- Connecticut General Statutes § 17b-112
- https://portal.ct.gov/dss/knowledge-base/articles/cash-assistance/temporary-family-assistance
- https://singlemotherguide.com/state/connecticut/TANF

**Effective Date:** Current as of 2024

**Implementation Notes:**
- This creates a "cliff" at 100% FPL where earnings start reducing benefits
- Different from many states that use percentage disregards
- Strongly encourages work while receiving TFA

### Extended Eligibility (Effective April 1, 2024)

**Six-Month Extension:**
Families whose total gross earnings exceed 100% FPL may be eligible for a 6-month extension of benefits.

**Eligibility:**
- Family's total gross earnings must be less than 230% FPL
- Extension lasts up to 6 consecutive months
- Family must have income less than 100% FPL to be eligible for extension

**Benefit Calculation During Extension:**
1. **Earnings 100% to 171% FPL:** Full benefit amount (no reduction)
2. **Earnings 171% to 230% FPL:** Benefit reduced by 20%
3. **Earnings above 230% FPL:** Ineligible

**References:**
- Connecticut General Statutes § 17b-112 (as amended, effective April 1, 2024)
- https://portal.ct.gov/dss/knowledge-base/articles/cash-assistance/temporary-family-assistance
- https://singlemotherguide.com/state/connecticut/TANF

**Effective Date:** April 1, 2024

**Implementation Notes:**
- This is a NEW policy as of April 1, 2024
- Designed to prevent cliff effects when families increase earnings
- The 20% reduction applies to the benefit amount, not income
- Extension can only be used once per TFA episode

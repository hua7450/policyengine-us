  note: "Increased from 100% to 230% FPL effective January 1, 2024 per State Plan: 'On and after January 1, 2024... the Department shall disregard, for purposes of eligibility, a family's total gross earnings in an amount not to exceed 230% of the FPL.' The 230% FPL disregard applies for up to 6 consecutive months after earnings first exceed 100% FPL. This simplified implementation does not model the 6-month time limit."

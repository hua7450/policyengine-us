description: Kentucky disregards this share of earned income based on months of K-TAP participation under the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program.
# NOTE: Uses calendar month as a proxy for participation months.
# The disregard cycle resets each January (month 1).
# In reality, the disregard tracks cumulative participation months.
# Pre-2023: $30 + 1/3 for 4 months, then $30 only for 8 months.
# Post-2023: 50% for 6 months, then no disregard.

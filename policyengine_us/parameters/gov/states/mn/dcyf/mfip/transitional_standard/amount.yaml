description: Minnesota provides this cash portion of the Transitional Standard under the Minnesota Family Investment Program.
# NOTE: MFIP is a combined cash+food program. Recipients receive food assistance
# through MFIP (not separate SNAP). This parameter models only the cash portion
# because SNAP is already modeled federally. The full Transitional Standard
# (cash + food) is used in regulation for eligibility and benefit calculation,
# but since PolicyEngine models SNAP separately, we use cash-only here to avoid
# double-counting food assistance. This means the Family Wage Level (110% of TS)
# used for eligibility is based on the cash portion, which is slightly stricter
# than regulation (which uses the full TS).

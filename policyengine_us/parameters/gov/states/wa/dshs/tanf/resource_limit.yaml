# Note: Before Feb 1, 2019, Washington had a two-tier resource limit structure:
# - Applicants: up to $1,000
# - Recipients: up to $1,000 plus an additional $3,000 in savings accounts
# This file uses the applicant limit ($1,000) for the pre-2019 period.
# E2SHB 1831 (2018) simplified this to a single $6,000 limit for all.

    Florida uses a two-step earned income disregard process:
    Step 1: Standard disregard per earner (person with earned income)
    Step 2: Flat amount plus percentage of remainder (work incentive disregard)

    Example with $90 per earner, $200 flat, 50% percentage:
    $1,000 gross earned income, 1 earner
    Step 1: $1,000 - $90 = $910

            $710 Ã— 0.5 = $355 (half disregarded)

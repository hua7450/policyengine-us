## Key Historical Timeline

| Date | Event | Impact |

Known amendment effective dates (from KY Legislature page and other sources):
- Original adoption (pre-1997, carried over from AFDC regulation)
- Various amendments in transition period (1997-2001)

## ERA 2: Post-2023 Overhaul (Feb 16, 2023 to Jan 20, 2025)

### Source: Current 921 KAR 2:016 (KY Legislature)

- **Date Range**: Feb 16, 2023 to present (base values; COLA adjustments apply annually)
- **Status**: VERIFIED - Complete post-2023 parameter set

#### Payment Maximums (monthly, base values)
| Family Size | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| 1 | $372 |

| 3 | $524 |
| 4 | $656 |

#### COLA Adjustment Mechanism
The 2023 amendment includes: "the payment maximum, gross income limit, and standard of need shall be the amount established in this section in addition to cost of living adjustments determined by the Social Security Administration that have taken place beginning in 2023."

**CROSS-REFERENCE NEEDED**: The WKMS article (Oct 2025) shows pre-November 2025 values that are HIGHER than the Feb 2023 base amounts for some family sizes (e.g., family of 2: $579 vs $450 base; family of 3: $723 vs $524 base). This suggests COLA adjustments were applied on top of the base amounts. The exact COLA-adjusted values for 2024 and 2025 need verification.

WKMS pre-November 2025 payment maximums (possibly COLA-adjusted):
| Family Size | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| 1 | $372 |
| 2 | $579 |
| 3 | $723 |
| 4 | $858 |
| 5 | $931 |
| 6 | $1,000 |
| 7+ | $964 |

**NOTE**: The family of 1 ($372) and 7+ ($964) match the 2023 base. The discrepancies in sizes 2-6 may reflect COLA adjustments OR may be errors in the article. This requires verification against official sources.

## Parameter Backdating Summary

Based on all sources, here is the backdating needed for each of the 10 parameter files:

### Parameters with Frozen Values (1995-2023)

For these parameters, the pre-2023 values were frozen since ~1995 and carried forward from AFDC:

1. **payment_maximum.yaml** - Add pre-2023 values (sizes 1-7: $186, $225, $262, $328, $383, $432, $482) effective from program inception (~1997-07-01 or earlier)
2. **standard_of_need.yaml** - Add pre-2023 values (sizes 1-7: $401, $460, $526, $592, $658, $724, $790) effective from program inception
3. **resource_limit.yaml** - Add pre-2023 value ($2,000) effective from program inception
4. **work_expense.yaml** - Add pre-2023 value ($90) effective from program inception
5. **earned_income_disregard_rate.yaml** - **FORMULA CHANGE**: Pre-2023 was NOT a simple 50% rate. It was "$30 + 1/3 of remainder" for 4 months, then "$30 only" for 8 more months. This represents a fundamentally different structure.
6. **child_support_disregard.yaml** - The $50 value appears unchanged across both eras. Verify whether it was $50 throughout.

### Parameters That May Have Changed in 2007/2009/2011/2015 Amendments

7. **dependent_care.yaml** - Pre-2023 values were $200 (under 2), $175 (2+, full-time), $150 (part-time). Verify if these changed in the 2007-2015 amendments.

### Parameters Likely Unchanged

8. **rate.yaml** (benefit rate = 55%) - Likely unchanged since program inception. The 45% ratable reduction is in both old and new regulation text.
9. **gross_income_limit_rate.yaml** (185%) - Likely unchanged since program inception. Both old and new versions use 185%.
10. **max_unit_size.yaml** (7) - Likely unchanged since program inception.

### Parameters That Need Nov 2025 Update

All parameters may need Nov 2025 values once the regulation amendment text is available. Currently confirmed:
- Payment maximums: $242, $293, $341, $426, $498, $562, $627

---

## Open Questions / CROSS-REFERENCE NEEDED

1. **COLA Adjustments**: The 2023 amendment included automatic COLA adjustments. Were the base values in the regulation actually adjusted for 2024 and 2025? The WKMS article shows different (higher) pre-November 2025 values for family sizes 2-6. Need to verify if these are official COLA-adjusted amounts or article errors.

2. **Earned Income Disregard Structure Change**: Pre-2023 used "$30 + 1/3" for 4 months then "$30 only" for 8 months. Post-2023 uses "50% of earned income" for 6 months. This is a fundamental formula change, not just a parameter value change.

3. **Intermediate Amendment Details**: What specifically changed in the 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2015 amendments? Were these only administrative/procedural changes, or did they affect any parameters?

4. **Nov 2025 Standard of Need**: The news articles only report new payment maximums. What are the new standard of need values and gross income limits?

5. **Exact Effective Dates for Pre-1997 Values**: When exactly were the AFDC values set that carried forward to K-TAP? Multiple sources say "1995" but the exact regulatory date is unclear. One source says "1990" for need standards and "1995" for payment maximums.

6. **Welfare Rules Database Verification**: Need to download and verify Kentucky values from the Urban Institute WRD for multiple years (1996-2023) to confirm the freeze. The database covers 1996-2023 and should confirm that payment maximums were truly unchanged.

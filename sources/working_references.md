# California CalWORKs (TANF) - Working References

## 1. Program Overview

California's TANF program is called **CalWORKs** (California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids), administered by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS). Created by AB 1542 in 1997, replacing California's AFDC program. The program provides cash assistance to low-income families with dependent children.

## 7. Income Eligibility Tests

### Applicant Gross Income Test:
1. Subtract $450 from each employed person's gross earned income (WIC 11450.12)
2. Add all remaining income (earned + unearned)
3. Compare total against MBSAC for family size and region
4. If total exceeds MBSAC, family is **ineligible**

### Recipient Net Income Test:
1. Subtract $600 from combined earned/disability-based income (WIC 11451.5)
2. Subtract 50% of remaining earned income
3. Add all unearned income (other than disability-based already disregarded)
4. Net income must be less than MAP for the AU's size/region/exempt status

## 9. Benefit Calculation Formula

**For Recipients:**
1. Calculate countable unearned income = disability-based income - $600 DBI disregard + other unearned income
2. Calculate countable earned income = (total earned income - $600) / 2
3. Total countable income = countable unearned + countable earned
4. **Grant = MAP - Total Countable Income**
5. If grant < $0, not eligible (or $0 grant)
6. If no income, grant = MAP

**For Applicants (eligibility determination):**
1. Subtract $450 from each employed person's earnings
2. Add remaining earnings + all unearned income
3. If total > MBSAC for family size/region: INELIGIBLE
4. If eligible, calculate grant using recipient formula

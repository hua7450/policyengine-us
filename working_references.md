## Implementation Notes

### Calculation Methodology

**Payment Standard Calculation:**
- Tied to 73% of Standard of Need
- Standard of Need = 55% of Federal Poverty Level
- Effective rate: 40% of FPL (0.73 × 0.55 = 0.4015)
- This creates automatic annual adjustment as FPL updates

**Income Eligibility Tests:**
Connecticut has **two income tests**:
1. **Initial eligibility**: Gross income < 55% FPL (with $90 earned income deduction per person at application)
2. **Continuing eligibility**: Earned income disregarded up to 100% FPL while receiving benefits

**Transitional Benefits (effective January 1, 2024):**
- When earnings exceed 100% FPL, up to 6 additional months possible
- Earnings between 100-171% FPL: Full benefit
- Earnings between 171-230% FPL: 20% benefit reduction
- Earnings above 230% FPL: Ineligible

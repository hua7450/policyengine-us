## Payment Standards

### Geographic Variation

Connecticut has different benefit levels based on geographic location due to housing cost differences. Benefit amounts vary by region.

**Example Payment Amount:**
- Family of 3 with no income in highest-cost area: $833/month
- Family of 3 with no income in most populous region: $833/month

**NOTE:** Complete payment standard tables by household size and region are in the TANF State Plan document but were not accessible for extraction. The payment standards appear to be fixed dollar amounts rather than percentage-of-FPG formulas.

**References:**
- Legal: CGS § 17b-112
- Policy: Connecticut TANF State Plan 2024-2026
- Policy: https://portal.ct.gov/dss/knowledge-base/articles/cash-assistance/temporary-family-assistance
- Policy: UPM Section 6000 - Calculation of Benefits

**Investigation Notes:**
- [ ] Payment standards appear to be fixed dollar amounts (not formula-based)
- [ ] Need to extract complete payment standard table from TANF State Plan PDF
- [ ] Geographic regions defined by housing costs

## Benefit Calculation

### General Formula

**For families with no income:**
- Benefit = Payment Standard for household size and region

**For families with earned income:**
1. Apply $90 disregard to each earner (at application)
2. OR exclude all earned income up to 100% FPL (for continuing recipients)
3. Subtract remaining countable income from payment standard

**For families with unearned income:**
- Unearned income counted dollar-for-dollar
- Benefit = Payment Standard - Unearned Income

     - Section 6030: Benefit Amount Calculation
   - Source: Connecticut DSS Uniform Policy Manual (accessible via portal.ct.gov/dss or sharinglaw.net)

3. **Income Definition Details:**
   - Verify if Connecticut has state-specific income source definitions beyond federal baseline
   - Check for additional income exclusions beyond those documented
   - Source: UPM Section 5000 subsections

4. **Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies:**
   - Identify relevant RCSA (Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies) sections for TFA

   - Source: Connecticut eRegulations System (eregulations.ct.gov)

5. **Historical Effective Dates:**
   - April 1, 2024 changes documented (36-month time limit, extension rules)
   - Need effective dates for other parameters (payment standards, resource limits, etc.)

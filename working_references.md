## Implementation Approach

### Use Federal Baseline (Simplified Implementation)

**Demographic Eligibility:**
- [x] Use federal demographic eligibility - Connecticut follows federal age thresholds
  - Minor child: less than 18 years of age
  - 18 years of age and attending secondary school or equivalent
  - Under age 24 attending post-secondary school (dependent student via FAFSA)
  - Under age 25 participating in TANF job training or subsidized employment

**Immigration Eligibility:**
- [x] Use federal baseline - Connecticut provides assistance to mandatory and optional qualified aliens as defined in Title IV of P.L. 104-193

**Income Sources:**
- [x] Use federal baseline income sources for simple implementation
- Connecticut defines earned vs unearned income but follows standard federal definitions

## Calculation Methodology

### Benefit Calculation Formula

**Step 1: Determine Countable Income**
1. Start with gross earned income
2. Apply $90 disregard for applicants (per person)
3. Apply 100% FPL disregard for recipients (household total)
4. Add unearned income (minus $50 child support passthrough)

**Step 2: Compare to Standard of Need**
- Applicants: Countable income must be < 55% FPL
- Recipients: Countable income must be < 100% FPL (standard)
- Recipients (Jan 1, 2024+): Can have earnings up to 230% FPL with special rules

**Step 3: Calculate Benefit**
- Maximum benefit = Payment Standard for family size (from table above)
- Actual benefit = Payment Standard - Countable Income
- Special rule (Jan 1, 2024+): If earnings 171%-230% FPL, 20% benefit reduction

**Example for Family of 3 (2024):**
- Payment Standard: $833
- Earned Income: $1,000/month
- Child Support Received: $100/month
- Calculation:
  - Gross earnings: $1,000
  - Less 100% FPL disregard: $0 countable earned (if < 100% FPL)
  - Unearned income: $100 - $50 passthrough = $50
  - Total countable: $50
  - Benefit: $833 - $50 = $783

## Implementation Notes

### Simplified vs. State-Specific Approach

**For this experimental CT TANF implementation, use FEDERAL BASELINE approach:**

1. **Demographics**: Use federal `is_demographic_tanf_eligible` variable
   - CT follows federal age thresholds (18/19/24/25)
   - No state-specific demographic rules needed

2. **Immigration**: Use federal `is_citizen_or_legal_immigrant` variable
   - CT follows federal qualified alien rules

3. **Income Sources**: Use federal `tanf_gross_earned_income` and `tanf_gross_unearned_income`
   - CT follows standard employment/self-employment definitions
   - Special exclusions (Census, child support) can be added as needed

4. **State-Specific Parameters Needed**:
   - Payment standards (table above)
   - Initial eligibility threshold (55% FPL)
   - Applicant earned income disregard ($90 per person)
   - Recipient earned income disregard (100% FPL)
   - Extension eligibility rules (100% FPL, 230% FPL with 20% reduction)
   - Child support exclusion ($50/month)
   - Asset limit ($6,000)
   - Vehicle exclusion ($9,500 equity)

### Key Formulas

```python
# Standard of Need (Applicant Eligibility)
standard_of_need = household_size * (federal_poverty_guideline * 0.55)

# Payment Standard (Benefit Amount)
payment_standard = CT_TFA_PAYMENT_STANDARDS[household_size]

# Earned Income Disregard - Applicant
applicant_disregard = household_members * 90

# Earned Income Disregard - Recipient
recipient_disregard = min(gross_earned_income, federal_poverty_guideline)

# Child Support Disregard
child_support_disregard = min(child_support_received, 50)

# Countable Income - Applicant
countable_income = (gross_earned - applicant_disregard) + (unearned - child_support_disregard)

# Countable Income - Recipient
countable_income = max(0, gross_earned - recipient_disregard) + (unearned - child_support_disregard)

# Benefit Amount
benefit = max(0, payment_standard - countable_income)

# Extension Rules (2024+)
if gross_earned > fpl_100 and gross_earned <= fpl_230:
    eligible_for_extension = True
    if gross_earned > fpl_171:
        benefit = benefit * 0.80  # 20% reduction
```

## Documentation Gaps and Notes

**Items NOT in this simplified implementation:**
- Work requirements details (exemptions captured above, but participation requirements not modeled)
- Time limit tracking (21/36-month clock, extensions, 60-month limits)
- Two-parent family special rules (45 CFR 261.24 definition)
- Sanction/penalty calculations for non-compliance
- Special benefits (transportation, child care for JFES participants)
- Minor parent special rules (beyond age thresholds)

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Add time limit tracking variables
- Model work participation requirements
- Implement sanction/penalty reductions
- Add support for transitional benefits (6-month extension after employment)
- Model Safety Net Services eligibility (post-time-limit families)
